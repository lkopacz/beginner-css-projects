# To Do
* Create a responsive layout site. Use Media Queries to create a mobile first (using `min-width` NOT `max-width`) web site.
  * Do not worry about creating a mobile menu that expands and collapses. Just be sure that they are stacked vertically in mobile.
  * In mobile, all content should be stacked in one column.
  * Be sure to use consistent breakpoints. Common breakpoints are 768px, 1024px, and 1440px.
